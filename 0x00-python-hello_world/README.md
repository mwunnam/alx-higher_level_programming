# This is not an empty file

## __Task 0 Write a shell script that runs a python scrip__
	* There are two was to do this
		* ./$filename
		* python3 "$filename"
	* Using python3 will help even if there is no permission
	for for the file to be executed
	* Using ./$filename means that you are sure there is permission
	for the said file

## __Task 1 Write a shell script that runs a python code or stript on terminal__
	* This is almost the same as the first but you have to add the -c option
	* This option tell python to compile the code from the terminal and there
	is no need for a file.
